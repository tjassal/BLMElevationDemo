 Compare elevation for Lotic AIM plots

 Project uses relative paths, so once you pull it down, simply open the .Rproj file to get going.

Objective: compare elevation (via PercentSlope) of AIM Lotic reaches; compare field elevation data with USGS 1 and 10 m 3DEP and elevatR data
Four parts to code: 1) prep Lotic AIM points for use in GEE; 2) run script in GEE; 3) import data from GEE and compare across data sets, 4) compare AIM data with elevatR data
